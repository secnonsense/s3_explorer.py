# s3_explorer.py
Gemini generated s3 bucket upload/download utility, using tkinter graphical interface. Requires local aws access keys stored at ~/.aws/credentials (or in the user home directory\\.aws\credentials on Windows). Also requires boto3 and at least Python 3.6. Depending on local color palette you may need to adjust color scheme via the dark mode button in the upper right hand corner of the ui. If running python3 that was installed by brew, you may need to install tkinter as well (brew install python-tk).
